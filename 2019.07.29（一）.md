０９：３４ code review 吧  
１０：０４ 看一下 color  
接著換  feature/geo-map-zoom-intl  
接續看 code review  

１１：１７ 修正自己的ＭＲ寫法  
/wisers-rnd/NodeJSWE6/merge_requests  

１３：５１ 繼續看 we6-component 的 test  
好好看一下三個 enzyme 的不同 render

### Shallow Rendering API
`Shallow` rendering is useful to
- constrain yourself to testing a component as a unit, and
- to ensure that your tests **aren't indirectly asserting** on behavior of **child components**

As of Enzyme v3, the shallow API does call React lifecycle methods such as
- componentDidMount and
- componentDidUpdate

### Full Rendering API (mount(...))
Full DOM rendering is ideal for use cases where
- you have components that may interact with DOM APIs or
- need to test components that are wrapped in higher order components.

Full DOM rendering requires that a full DOM API be available at the global scope.  
This means that it must be run in an environment that at least “looks like” a browser environment.  
If you do not want to run your tests inside of a browser,  
the recommended approach to using mount is to depend on a library called jsdom which is essentially a headless browser implemented completely in JS.  

Note: **unlike shallow or static rendering**
- full rendering actually `mounts` the component in the DOM
- which means that tests can affect each other if they are all using the same DOM
- Keep that in mind while writing your tests
  - and, if necessary, use .unmount() or something similar as cleanup.

### Static Rendering API
Use enzyme's `render` function
- to generate HTML from your React tree, and analyze the resulting HTML structure.

render uses a third party HTML parsing and traversal library `Cheerio`
